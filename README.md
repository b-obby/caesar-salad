# caesar-salad
A Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption tool created with Python
 

### Before creating the tool, it is imporatant to understand what a Ceasar Cipher even is.
>
>A **Caesar Cipher** is when the letters of the alphabet are shifted left or right by n places. 
>* For example, the default english alphabet starts with `abcd...` 
>* If we want to use the Caesar Cipher to shift our alphabet left by 1 place, our alphabet would now be `bcde...  `
>
>Imagine visually watching your alphabet shift left: B has taken A's spot, and A now has been pushed to the back of the line. 
>
>If we were to use this example key alphabet to encrypt the following phrase: "hire me" our output would look like "ijsf nf" 
>While this iteration was simple to manually encrypt, ceasar shifts can get with longer pieces of plaintext and with shifts larger than n = 1. 

### To kill two birds with one stone, I am creating a tool that can perform both encryption and decryption tasks. 

- [ ] I will also consider creating a bash version to have two options
